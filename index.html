            <p class="secsubTag small-text">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>

            <p class="secsubTag small-text">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
                
                For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.</p>

            <p class="secsubTag small-text padding">Let's Build a World Together contains more songs celebrating the fairy tale romance of country music's royal couple featuring producer Billy Sherrill's Phil Spector-influenced production. Regardless of what the reality may have been, country fans couldn't get enough of the pair who appeared to be living every word they sang. As Eugene Chadbourne of AllMusic astutely observes, "The chemistry that develops between partners in a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based on fantasy, as was obviously the case with Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb, who no country listener even imagined for a moment were romantically involved. Tammy Wynette and George Jones, on the other hand, did have a relationship." The truth was not as idyllic as their fans preferred to imagine it. Years later, in the documentary Stand By Your Dream, Wynette recalled, "It was very difficult on us, both of us being in the business and both of us being together twenty-four hours a day
